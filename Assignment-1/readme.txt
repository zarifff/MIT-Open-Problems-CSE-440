The python scrips are straightforward to run.
The only extra libraries required is matplotlib and operators

tweet_sentiment.py, happiest_state.py require an additional parameter after starting execution
A 'y' or any other character to choose if you want to incorporate a dynamically generated
dictionary into the tweet scores. This process takes much longer.

Included is an additional dictionary python file.

The size of the largest dataset is close to 6GB so it will take some time to run through all of the scripts.

The 2_june.json file is corrupted due to an unexpected interrupt (load-shedding!)

This is why try-except clauses have been added to get around reading this file
